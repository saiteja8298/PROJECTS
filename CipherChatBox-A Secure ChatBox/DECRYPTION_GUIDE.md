# 🔓 Decryption Tab - User Guide

## ✅ **New Feature Added: Decryption Tab**

I've added a **Decryption Tab** to your CipherChat interface that allows you to decrypt messages from your friends!

## 🎯 **How to Use the Decryption Tab:**

### **Step 1: Open the Decryption Panel**
- Look for the **🔓 unlock icon** in the top-right corner of the chat interface
- Click it to open the decryption panel

### **Step 2: Enter the Encrypted Message**
- **Paste the encrypted text** that your friend sent you
- This is the scrambled/encrypted version of their message
- Use the large text area for long encrypted messages

### **Step 3: Enter the Decryption Key**
- **Enter the same key** that your friend used to encrypt the message
- This should be the key they shared with you privately
- The key field is password-protected for security

### **Step 4: Select the Cipher Algorithm**
- **Choose the same encryption method** your friend used
- Options: AES, DES, TripleDES, RC4, Blowfish
- Make sure it matches what your friend used to encrypt

### **Step 5: Decrypt the Message**
- Click **"🔓 Decrypt Message"** button
- The decrypted message will appear in the result box below
- If successful, you'll see the original message!

## 🔐 **Security Features:**

### **Safe Decryption**
- All decryption happens client-side
- Your decryption key is never sent to the server
- Encrypted messages are processed locally

### **Multiple Cipher Support**
- Supports all 5 encryption algorithms
- Choose the correct one your friend used
- Each cipher has different security levels

### **Error Handling**
- Clear error messages if decryption fails
- Check your key and cipher selection
- Try different combinations if needed

## 🎨 **Interface Features:**

### **Modern Design**
- Matches the black theme of CipherChat
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Professional, secure appearance

### **User-Friendly**
- Large text areas for long messages
- Clear labels and instructions
- Easy-to-use buttons

### **Responsive**
- Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Adapts to different screen sizes
- Touch-friendly on mobile devices

## 💡 **Tips for Success:**

### **Getting the Right Information**
1. **Ask your friend** for the exact encryption key they used
2. **Confirm the cipher algorithm** (AES, DES, etc.)
3. **Copy the encrypted text exactly** - no extra spaces or characters

### **Common Issues**
- **Wrong key**: Make sure you have the exact key your friend used
- **Wrong cipher**: Verify which encryption method was used
- **Corrupted text**: Ensure the encrypted message was copied completely

### **Best Practices**
- **Share keys securely** (not through the same chat)
- **Use strong keys** for better security
- **Test with a simple message first**

## 🚀 **How It Works:**

1. **Friend encrypts message** → Sends you encrypted text + key + cipher
2. **You receive encrypted message** → Copy the encrypted text
3. **Open decryption tab** → Paste text, enter key, select cipher
4. **Click decrypt** → See the original message!
